    <h1>Japan</h1>
    <h2>Japan is an archipelago on the eastern edge of Asia. There are four main islands: Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. There are also nearly 4,000 smaller islands! Japan's nearest mainland neighbors are the Siberian region of Russia in the north and Korea and China farther south. Almost 4/5 of Japan is covered with mountains. The Japanese Alps run down the center of the largest island, Honshu. The highest peak is Mount Fuji.</h2>

    <h3>Japan was a very fun place that I traveled to. There was lots of very fun things to do, and very tasty food (like sushi). We also visited many famous landmarks in Japan such as: Himeji Castle, Kinkaku-ji, Fushimi Inari Taisha, Kiyomizu-dera, The Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, and many other temples in Kyoto. And we also went to Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, Japan. When we were there, we went on lots of fun rides such as the Harry Potter ride. We also had a cool huge included buffet every morning at our hotel! Our family also visited a hot spring and I hopped in the sping. Turns out, that was a very bad idea. It was EXTREMELY hot and I instantly hopped out and had to lower myself in the hot spring VERY slowly to get used to the heat.</h3>
